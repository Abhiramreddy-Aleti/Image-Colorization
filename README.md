# Image-Colorization

I. Project Understanding

A. Introduction

ðŸ“˜ Pix2pix is a powerful model for image-to-image translation tasks, but it can be further improved for specific applications such as colorization. One way to improve the performance of pix2pix for colorization is to use a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) instead of the traditional GAN architecture. WGANs use the Wasserstein distance metric to train the generator and discriminator, which can help stabilize the training process and produce more realistic results.
Another way to improve the performance of pix2pix for colorization is to use a U-Net architecture based on residual blocks. U-Net is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is well-suited for image segmentation tasks. It consists of a series of convolutional layers and max pooling layers, with skip connections between layers of the same resolution. This allows the network to learn fine details of the input image, which can be particularly useful for colorization tasks.

Residual blocks are a type of building block for neural networks, which consist of multiple layers with skip connections. The skip connections allow the gradient to pass through the layers more easily, which can help the network converge faster and produce better results.

Using WGAN with a U-Net architecture based on residual blocks can help improve the performance of pix2pix for colorization by providing better stability and improved ability to learn fine details of the input image.

ðŸ“Œ The goal of this paper is :

The goal of the "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" (pix2pix) paper is to propose a method for image-to-image translation using a conditional GAN architecture.
The method uses a generator network that is trained to convert images from one domain (e.g. sketches) to another domain (e.g. photographs).
The generator is trained using a combination of adversarial loss and L1 loss.
The generator takes an image from the input domain and a random noise as input, and generates an image in the target domain.
The discriminator network is trained to classify the generated image as real or fake, based on whether it is similar to a target image from the target domain.
The paper uses the patch GAN architecture to discriminator with 70x70 patches.
The authors showed the effectiveness of the proposed method on a variety of image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting edges to photographs, day to night, and labels to street scenes.
