# Image-Colorization

I. Project Understanding

A. Introduction

ðŸ“˜ Pix2pix is a powerful model for image-to-image translation tasks, but it can be further improved for specific applications such as colorization. One way to improve the performance of pix2pix for colorization is to use a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) instead of the traditional GAN architecture. WGANs use the Wasserstein distance metric to train the generator and discriminator, which can help stabilize the training process and produce more realistic results.
Another way to improve the performance of pix2pix for colorization is to use a U-Net architecture based on residual blocks. U-Net is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is well-suited for image segmentation tasks. It consists of a series of convolutional layers and max pooling layers, with skip connections between layers of the same resolution. This allows the network to learn fine details of the input image, which can be particularly useful for colorization tasks.
